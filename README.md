# sinatra-journal-article-manager
This application creates relationships between journal articles, authors, and journals. It allows users to create a collection that they can add and delete articles from. They can also add details about articles that other users can contribute to (but not delete). Users can also add new Journals and Authors to the database as well.

To run, navigate to the local host location provided by rack. The app's home page can be found there.
